										<h3>A little history</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Following graduation with a degree in <span class="skill">physics</span>, I spent a year travelling and working in south east Asia. I returned to further studies with a strong  technical component and went on to join the <span class="skill">IT Graduate Scheme</span> at North West Water.</p> 
									<p>The graduate scheme involved placements developing a broad awareness of IT functions. On completion, I worked 5 years as a <span class="skill">database administrator</span>. Responsibilities included maintenance, backup and recovery of business critical databases, problem investigation and resolution to meet Service Level Agreements. I also provided support to application developers through the creation of test environments. During this time the team became  part of the outsourcing branch of <span class="skill">United Utilities</span> and were later transferred to Cap Gemini. I took voluntary redundancy on the birth of  my second child.</p>
									<p>Since then Iâ€™ve taken on a mixed bag of <span class="skill">part-time roles</span> alongside my caring responsibilities - ranging from adult learner supporter and office work to commissioned portrait artist(!). These diverse roles have all taught me something new. But where time allowed or the opportunity arose I returned to tinkering on the computer - creating websites for myself and an art group, learning about digital image manipulation and experimenting with coding puzzles and algorithms.</p>
									<p>As caring responsibilities have reduced I have enjoyed more <span class="skill">curiosity driven analytical projects</span>  bringing my technical skills up to date through self guided learning. Late 2020 I joined the Manchester <span class="skill">Tech Returners</span> programme. This has given me the opportunity to <span class="skill">collaborate</span> on a Tech for Good project. I have learned both front end and back end skills and applied them in the development of an app. Although challenging at times I am thoroughly enjoying the experience. </p>

									<h3>Things I can do</h3>
									<p>I am working in a small team on a project for the Tech Returners Programme. We are making good use of <span class="skill">Git</span> for code control and following an <span class="skill">Agile</span>  methodology. I have developed skills with <span class="skill">React</span> to build the front end. Our <span class="skill">REST API</span> is written in <span class="skill">C#</span> and connects via <span class="skill">Lambda functions</span> with a <span class="skill">MySQL</span> database hosted on <span class="skill">AWS</span>.</p>

									<p>On personal projects I have used <span class="skill">Python3</span> in <span class="skill">Jupyter Notebooks</span> to analyse local air quality data. This required transforming the data from formatted <span class="skill">R</span> objects into <span class="skill">Pandas</span> dataframes and dealing with the challenges of missing data, daily and seasonal cycles and 'noise'. I made use of <span class="skill">Matplotlib</span> for data visualisations and learned just enough <span class="skill">JavaScript</span> and <span class="skill">D3</span> for some interactive visualisations. I have also used Python and <span class="skill">Matlab (Octave)</span> to test out some machine learning techniques.</p>

									<p>During my time as a database administrator I made extensive use of <span class="skill">DB2</span>, <span class="skill">Oracle</span>,<span class="skill">SQL</span> and <span class="skill">pl/SQL</span> on IBM mainframe and <span class="skill">Unix</span> platforms. I also, many years ago, learned to program in <span class="skill">C++</span>, <span class="skill">C</span> and <span class="skill">Fortran77</span>(!).</p>
									
									<p>I have created a number of simple websites using <span class="skill">Wordpress</span> and <span class="skill">Wix</span>. Besides using templates I have learned to use <span class="skill">cpanel</span> and some <span class="skill">HTML</span> and <span class="skill">CSS</span>. I can also manipulate digital images using <span class="skill">Gimp</span>.</p>

									<h3>Transferable Skills</h3>
									<p>I have an MSc in geophysics and enjoy working with data. More recently I have developed my skills in <span class="skill">data analysis</span> through curiosity driven projects. I experimented with a variety of <span class="skill">data visualisations</span> creating maps, barcharts, smoothed time series and statistical plots of aggregated data. These charts evolved from basic graphs using default options to more carefully designed layouts following data visualisation best practice for maximum insight.</p>

									<p>I consider myself quite <span class="skill">flexible</span> and a <span class="skill">team player</span>, always willing to adapt as the need arises. I have supported a number of clubs through work on committees - e.g. health & safety rep at the pre-school, secretary for the running club. Currently I am <span class="skill">collaborating</span> on a Tech for Good app. I have worked with both the <span class="skill">general public</span> - stewarding art exhibitions and dealing with tenancy applications - as well as the more technically minded. I <span class="skill">love to learn</span> and have made use of online courses, books, blogs and websites to pick up what I needed for the project in hand - whether it be a simple website for a local art group, or playing with the development of a connect4 game using reinforcement learning.</p>
									
									<p>I spent a year <span class="skill">tutoring</span> maths at all levels up to A level. I also volunteered at a local college supporting adult learners with numeracy.</p>

									<h3>Why Tech Returners?</h3>
									<p>I was introduced to the Manchester Tech Returners Programme by a close friend. After reading their online blurb and case studies it seemed just what I needed... </p>
									<p>I moved for the job many moons ago. As a result I had no family support to help juggle child care. I abandoned a career in tech due to the need for flexible employment - no need for violins. I have no regrets. But it has meant a lengthy break from directly relevant work experience and my current tech skills are largely self-taught.</p>
									<p>I still love <span class="skill">the satisfaction of working through a problem</span> and looking at <span class="skill">data</span>. I would love to make it more of my day job. The tech returners programme will give me the opportunity to show what I can do and take me the next step on my journey. </p>
