						<h3>A little history</h3>
					</header>
					<p>I worked 6 yrs at United Utilities, mostly in Data Services responsible for Oracle and DB2
						business critical systems.</p>
					<p>I had a career break to raise a family. This was an opportunity to broaden my experience. I
						worked with a diverse range of people in roles both paid & voluntary - ranging from adult
						learner supporter and office admin to commissioned portrait artist(!). But I still love the satisfaction of working
						through a problem. So I maintained tech
						skills through online courses, books and blogs as well as curiosity driven personal projects.
					</p>
					<p>Iâ€™m fascinated by the visual display of data. I really enjoyed finding the best way to present
						local air quality data for maximum insight. These noisy sets of time series were available
						online as formatted R objects which I processed with python and reported on with Jupyter
						notebooks.</p>
					<p>Now that my caring responsibilities are over I've appreciated the opportunity to take part in the Tech Returners
						Programme - collaborating on a project and with the aim of a return to work in data analytics.

					<h3>Things I can do</h3>
					<p>I am working in a small team on a project for the Tech Returners Programme. We are making good
						use of <span class="skill">Git</span> for code control and following an <span
							class="skill">Agile</span> methodology. I have developed skills with <span
							class="skill">React</span> to build the front end. Our <span class="skill">REST API</span>
						is written in <span class="skill">C#</span> and connects via <span class="skill">Lambda
							functions</span> with a <span class="skill">MySQL</span> database hosted on <span
							class="skill">AWS</span>.</p>

					<p>On personal projects I have used <span class="skill">Python3</span> in <span
							class="skill">Jupyter Notebooks</span> to analyse local air quality data. This required
						transforming the data from formatted <span class="skill">R</span> objects into <span
							class="skill">Pandas</span> dataframes and dealing with the challenges of missing data,
						daily and seasonal cycles and 'noise'. I made use of <span class="skill">Matplotlib</span> for
						data visualisations and learned just enough <span class="skill">JavaScript</span> and <span
							class="skill">D3</span> for some interactive visualisations. I have also used Python and
						<span class="skill">Matlab (Octave)</span> to test out some machine learning techniques.
					</p>

					<p>During my time as a database administrator I made extensive use of <span
							class="skill">DB2</span>, <span class="skill">Oracle</span>,<span class="skill">SQL</span>
						and <span class="skill">pl/SQL</span> on IBM mainframe and <span class="skill">Unix</span>
						platforms. I also, many years ago, learned to program in <span class="skill">C++</span>, <span
							class="skill">C</span> and <span class="skill">Fortran77</span>(!).</p>

					<p>I have created a number of simple websites using <span class="skill">Wordpress</span> and <span
							class="skill">Wix</span>. Besides using templates I have learned to use <span
							class="skill">cpanel</span> and some <span class="skill">HTML</span> and <span
							class="skill">CSS</span>. I can also manipulate digital images using <span
							class="skill">Gimp</span>.</p>

					<h3>Transferable Skills</h3>
					<p>I have an MSc in geophysics and enjoy working with data. More recently I have developed my skills
						in <span class="skill">data analysis</span> through curiosity driven projects. I experimented
						with a variety of <span class="skill">data visualisations</span> creating maps, barcharts,
						smoothed time series and statistical plots of aggregated data. These charts evolved from basic
						graphs using default options to more carefully designed layouts following data visualisation
						best practice for maximum insight.</p>

					<p>I consider myself quite <span class="skill">flexible</span> and a <span class="skill">team
							player</span>, always willing to adapt as the need arises. I have supported a number of
						clubs through work on committees - e.g. health & safety rep at the pre-school, secretary for the
						running club. Currently I am <span class="skill">collaborating</span> on a Tech for Good app. I
						have worked with both the <span class="skill">general public</span> - stewarding art exhibitions
						and dealing with tenancy applications - as well as the more technically minded. I <span
							class="skill">love to learn</span> and have made use of online courses, books, blogs and
						websites to pick up what I needed for the project in hand - whether it be a simple website for a
						local art group, or playing with the development of a connect4 game using reinforcement
						learning.</p>

					<p>I spent a year <span class="skill">tutoring</span> maths at all levels up to A level. I also
						volunteered at a local college supporting adult learners with numeracy.</p>

					<h3>Why Tech Returners?</h3>
					<p>I was introduced to the Manchester Tech Returners Programme by a close friend. After reading
						their online blurb and case studies it seemed just what I needed... </p>
					<p>I moved for the job many moons ago. As a result I had no family support to help juggle child
						care. I abandoned a career in tech due to the need for flexible employment - no need for
						violins. I have no regrets. But it has meant a lengthy break from directly relevant work
						experience and my current tech skills are largely self-taught.</p>
					<p>I still love <span class="skill">the satisfaction of working through a problem</span> and looking
						at <span class="skill">data</span>. I would love to make it more of my day job. The tech
						returners programme will give me the opportunity to show what I can do and take me the next step
						on my journey. </p>
